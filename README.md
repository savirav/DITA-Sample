# DITA-Sample
Welcome! Here's sharing a slice of my life in the tech space.
# Introduction
This is a sample assignment I created to demonstrate my skills in DITA. It talks about a text editor tool I frequently use for my projects.

# Viewing the files
To view the files in this repo, you will need an **XML editor**. There are many open-sourced and proprietary tools available in the market for the purpose. In my case, I used the personal edition of XMLMIND XML Editor.

# Why I chose XMLMIND XML Editor
This editor is equipped with advanced tools that ease the editing and publishing of complex DITA documents. The interface is simple, and you can very well use this editor for editing other XML documents, however sans the help of advanced features.

Here's the download link - [XMLMIND Personal Edition](http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml)

## Opening the files:
 1. Download the zipped file.
 2.  Unzip the contents into a folder. 
 3. Open the XML editor tool. 
 4. Go to **File ⇾ Open** and choose the file "notepadplusplus.ditamap~”.

There you go!
